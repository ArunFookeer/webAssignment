	  <p><b>Yulimar Rojas,</b> She made history in triple jump at Tokyo 2020 in 2021, and kept going on her quest in 2022. Yulimar Rojas broke her own world record at the Olympics in 2022 with a 15.67m mark, 
	  doing so on her last jump while she had already secured her gold medal - one of the best moments of the Games.
	  <p><b>Kristóf Milák,</b> he became Olympic champion at Tokyo 2020 in 2021, as well as winning silver in the 100m butterfly event. 
	  Arriving at this year’s World Championships, in his hometown of Budapest, he was the star even before touching the water - 
	  so after beating his own world record in the 200m butterfly event (1:50.34), over three seconds ahead the rising star from France Léon Marchand, he was feted as a local hero. 
	  Three days later, he conquered gold in the 100m butterfly event showing the world that he’s now the undisputed butterfly king.
